## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2018-09-11
### Fixed
- Fixed some issues with installing on mac due to PyYaml not being properly
  installed by setuptools
  ([#2](https://github.com/oslomarketsolutions/pre-commit-maven-plugin/issues/2))

## [0.2.2] - 2018-08-07
### Fixed
- Fixes an issue with detecting the correct python binary ([#1][issue-1])

## [0.2.1] - 2018-06-11
### Fixed
- Made version checking smarter to support systems where `python` is a symlink
  to python 2

## [0.2.0] - 2018-06-09
### Added
- New argument `hookTypes` for installing multiple different hook types
- Python output is now always written to maven output. `download-binary` is very
  verbose and is therefore written to DEBUG which requires `-X` to see.

### Changed
- Changed the `version` argument to `precommitVersion` to differentiate it from
  the plugin version

## [0.1.0] - 2018-06-06
### Added
- Initial release of the plugin
